# matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 homework, based on clinical trials on mice of anti-cancer medications, the purpose of which is to compare the performance of Capomulin against other drug regimens.  The data is prepared and cleaned, and summary statistics of tumor volume vs drug regimen generated.  Two bar charts of number of data rows vs drug regimen are produced, one using Pandas, the other Matplotlib.  A pie chart of mouse sex distribution is produced using Matplotlib. Quartiles and outliers of final tumor volume for the four most promising drug regimens are calculated, and a box plot produced.  A line plot for a single mouse on Capomulin is produced, and a scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin drug regimen.  Code is in Python 3.10.
